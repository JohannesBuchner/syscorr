SysCorr - Bayesian correlation swiss army knife
=================================================

Tests correlations between datapoints with uncertainties.

What can it do?
-----------------
* Testing if correlation exists (vs independence)
* Estimating parameters of the dependence (line + systematic error, or higher-order polynomial, ...)
* Plot the resulting correlation with its uncertainty
* Hierarchical Bayesian analysis (with intermediate prior)
